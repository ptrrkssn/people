This is a small C program, acting as a frontend to the
rwho command. It reformats the output in a people-oriented way.

"people" is free software, available under the GNU Public License v2.

The "getopt" files are from the Gnu project.

The program may be used as a simple "fingerd" replacement and
will try to have as one if called under the name "fingerd".
For example if you have this in your /etc/inetd.conf file:

	finger stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/local/bin/people fingerd

To compile it, simple do "./configure ; make" and then do
"make install" to install it and the manual page in /usr/local/bin
and /usr/local/man/man1. See the file INSTALL for more specific
instructions regarding options to the "configure" script.
